Callum,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the first time I had been sent a product before it was publicly released in order to write a review, so I felt it only right to do a thorough product analysis. Below I have left a pros on cons list with explanations for each point.Pros:Sound - The sound is excellent, no two ways about it, no static, no hum and no muffling. It sounded sharp and clear for music, videos and telephone conversations.Microphone - This headset allows you to do hands free calls with it's built in, internal, microphone. Due to the microphone being inside the right ear drum I was worried that my voice would sound quiet but, according to the person on the other side of the phone, it doesn't sound any different from a normal phone call.Glasses - You'll have no problem wearing glasses while sporting the headset. It doesn't cause any pinching or squeezing.Light-weight - It's surprisingly light. Most wireless headsets have a bit of heft to them but, this one, I can imagine carry around without worrying about getting tired.Durable - With it's size and weight I was worried that it wouldn't be able to survive falling off someone head. So in order to find out I dropped it onto a hardwood floor from about 6 ft, twice, and was pleasantly surprised that not only did it survive but didn't have a mark on it.Cons:Little sound cancelling - It does very little to stop noise from escaping or entering. I found that while playing music the people around me could hear what I was playing if I had my volume at around 50%, I could also hear most things that were going on around me.Size - It's quite small, which can be a good thing, but I found the ear pads weren't able to cover my ears (Which may be while there's little sound cancelling). I had a female friend try them and she found that it was actually a tad too big, causing the pads to hang a bit low on her head.No head padding - Usually you'll find a pad on arch on the headset to add comfort, but not on this headset. I found the hard plastic very uncomfortable. However someone else I had wear the headset didn't mind the lack of pad, so I guess it'll depend on your head shape.Small charging cable - This is a small quibble but the charger that came in the box is remarkable small. It's a standard C charger port so this won't be a problem for most people.Overall it's not perfect, but for the current selling price of £50 I think you'll get more than your monies worth.",Full review and durability test
Castle Reviews,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have tried a multitude of headphones over the years everything from JVC, Sony, Sennheiser, Philips, WeSC to Grado, Bang & Olufsen and everything in-between. For my money, Grado makes the very best over-ear headphones I have ever bought and they also have exemplary after-sales service. I received these Sony headphones and they are the sixth Sony's I have tested. I have tested the 1000 M3's to a set which retailed over £200 which were designed for Hi Fidelity and now these. From the packaging to the actual product they are nice quality and the sound they produce, given the price, is very good.The big problem in rating headphones and earbuds is that the sound they produce and how they sound is very subjective to review, as two people can listen to a piece of music but they can hear that piece of music differently. In light of this, I am going to try and be as objective about these Earphones as I can.Let us start this review by considering the price, £49.99 at the time of review. This is a good price given the quality of what you are given. They are extremely well made. Everything from the box to the headpiece appears to be top quality., given the low price The headphones themselves are made of quality materials and are quite light. What is not good is that there is no cushioning on the headband. They are not that comfortable to wear over a long period, as I have a large head and need some cushioning.The sound they produce is very good given the price. The reproduction is rich and clear, the bass is fantastic, the middle range is clear and defined and the treble is delightful. The only downside to these phones is the bass, it just lacks a bit of depth.I was not expecting great things from these headphones, yet what they give you in terms of sound quality is very good, given the price. To summarise, these headphones are very well made and produce a sound that is very good. They offer value far beyond the price point. Where they are let down is in the noise-cancelling department. These phones are designed to be used on the go. The amount of background noise is, therefore, going to be loud. This set has no noise-cancelling system and so it kind of defeats the purpose of the set. You have to ask yourself, do you need NC as you journey around? If you don't need it, these are pretty good headphones for the price.",Pretty Good
Alex Jones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted to wait a few weeks so I could give a fair review.I must say I am impressed with these headphones!To give a bit of background, these are the first set of wireless headphones I have owned. Previous to that I owned a pair of wired Sony headphones, similar to these. I love my music, and really enjoy listening to good quality sound.My initial impressions on the headphones are good. They feel very sturdy and I love how the ear cups twist so that the headphones can be stored flat in my rucksack.Connection to Bluetooth was very quick and easy, and I was able to start listening to Spotify on my phone within 2 minutes!After a full charge overnight, I was intreiged to see how long the headphones would actually last, given the advertised 35 hour battery life!Whilst I haven't kept a diary persay, as a minimum I use the headphones for at least 4 hours a day on my commute to and from work. Each time you turn the headphones on, you have a battery notice played to you, as well as a battery indicator shown on my phone. The headphones lasted for around 7 or 8 days before the headphones advised me to recharge. I haven't run the headphones right down flat, but I would say the 35 hour life is very accurate.These are on ear headphones so it would be unreasonable to expect complete noise cancelling. I wanted a pair of headphones that would not deaden my surroundings completely as I think it's important you aren't completely unaware. However I would say the headphones cancel noise enough to be able to hear the music.I occasionally use the headphones to make and receive telephone calls, both in the office at my desk and whilst commuting. The quality is fantastic, and I've not experienced any problems with the person on the other end not being able to hear me - big thumbs up for this feature!Thinking about the reviews I saw before buying these headphones, I will do my best to remember them and give my own thoughts.- The volume of the headphones are too low, even on the highest setting.I saw a few reviews saying this, both on amazon and a few other sources. I have personally not had any issues with the volume (or lack of) on these headphones. My music taste is varied, and even the softer genres play just fine for me. It may be worth noting that there are two volumes to adjust, your phone and the headphones themselves. Depending on the device you may also be able to adjust the graphic equaliser somewhat if needed.- The headphones are too tight on my headThere has only been one occasion where I have experienced a bit of pain on my one ear, however I think they were ill-fitted as I adjusted them on my ears and they were fine thereafter. I would say I have an average sized head! I think you have to bear in mind that these headphones sit on your ears, so they will compress somewhat, so they stay on your head.I would not want them to be looser as I would be conscious they would slide around and potentially fall off my head.Some have suggested that the band itself is uncomfortable, again, I've not had any issues with this regard.All in all I think these are a really great set of headphones for the price.If your a more serious music listener then you may want to consider an alternative option, but I would consider these suitable for most!",3 Weeks In... I'm Impressed!
Achille M,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought the black version, for WFH, have some support calls.- First issue is the comfort, this is not comfortable at all. The cushion goes on top of your ears and hurts after a while.- The sound is nothing remarkable, noise cancelling is non-existent. Not that I was expecting something different for this price range.Now the real issues:- When having a call, I can hear my voice, the quality of the sound drops and it really makes very hard to understand what is going on.- The real reason I'm making this review is because now I tried with two machines (Windows and Mac) and I realised the device disconnects itself from the bluetooth randomly, is like the headphone restarts itself, disconnects from the bluetooth, tells me the battery and then connects again. This has happened three times in two different machines. Note that once this was IN THE MIDDLE OF A SUPPORT CALL.Hope this goes to the manufacturer.",Subpar at most
John M,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The ratings  I have given reflect the price, about £35.  I am very pleased -  bought them for listening to podcasts, making calls, and a bit of music.This is actually the second pair, the first had a very unstable bluetooth connection to my Huawei P9.  The reference guide cautions against using it near wifi devices but wifi is everywhere now, and I have no problem with my Plantronics earpiece and other devices so I decided the first pair was faulty and sent it back.  The replacement arrived the next day and proved me right - the second pair works perfectly.There is no noise cancellation but isolation is quite good, I can't hear my wife talking to me at all when listening to music. They are not the most hifi of headphones but at the price they are perfectly OK - natural, rather than boomy bass and not over bright.  Just as well because I have found no way of adjusting anything but the volume on the headphone or the Huawei.Call quality is...good enough [EDIT: after 3 months use I would be less grudging - I have yet to have trouble hearing or being heard].  The first pair had poor microphone gain but I have had no complaints [after many] long calls on this second set.  Not quite as precise as the £15 wired Sonys that this item replaces, but I ascribe that to the microphone being further from the mouth.  It's just a little bit echoey, and one's own voice is delivered into the earpieces which was a bit odd for a minute or two but I seem to have got used to it now and don't notice. [EDIT:  Since I wrote the above, and thanks to the BBC Rutherford & Fry podcast, I now know that this 'feedback' is just the deliberately engineered ""sidetone"", part of the purpose of which is to prevent people speaking too loudly on calls.  I am completely accustomed to the headphones now and I am never aware of it].I have read  that the older CH500, available for a similar price from Amazon, has better call quality and is marginally better for music - but it is not quite as compact, nor does it charge as quickly or last as long - 20 rather than 35 hours per charge.Happy to recommend these.UPDATE.  The battery life is indeed good.  It typically three or four days, used for 2-3 hours each day, before the ""full battery"" message at switch on became approximately 70%"".  I recharged them anyway and continue to do so within a day or two of this alert.One caveat - I have an average sized bonce but I need very little extension on this headset.  My wife's head is rather smaller, and in fact it is slightly too big for her at minimum size.  If a standard baseball cap is too big for you, probably best look elsewhere.","Great for the money, solid bluetooth, good for phone calls"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for a low cost Bluetooth headphones, clear sound, NOT nfc so works with my laptop, smartphone & smart TV. Fairly big battery, lasts me 3/4days usage. Bluetooth connection is very good, some dropout when moving around (about 5m from device). Sleek minimalist design, very light too and comfy. Far superior to JVC equivalent.",Best in class
Tobias,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just a short review for any potential buyers that are unsure.Generally I’m happy with these headphones, but wish I had the patience to shop round.The look is smart and clean, with a textured finish which works for me as I mainly use them in a gym. However they do feel cheap. An all plastic finish and the ear pieces are loose and moves easily, almost too easily.They have a good fit and are snug. I’d imagine they would eventually get warm on the ears as they’re on-ear rather than over-ear.Sound quality is average. I’ve have marked them at £30-40 headphones. Good amount of bass but not particularly crisp mid and high ends. £50 seems steep. I was slightly underwhelmed - but contradictorily I’m sure I’ll like them and put them through their paces.",Good all round. But not amazing.
Georgia,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't believe these have so many good reviews. I have quiet small ears but these are absolutley tiny on me and barely cover my ears! Am I missing something and are these for kids or something?? I can't believe this is meant to fit adult ears, I have such small ears.Because they don't fit the ears properly this makes them highly uncomfortable to wear and also noise seeps out.I wish I could return these but I cant due to COVID-19.So a waste of money when I was hoping to watch some videos in peace without disturbing others.",Don't listen to other reviews!
SnowCherry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After years of using wired decided to move to wireless Bluetooth.Wow. How headphones sound is completely individual to the person listening and even tho these are really entry level sound superb to me.I have a Bluetooth Sony turntable so it was my main reason for purchase.It was a bit tricky pairing but once up and running sounds wonderful and if I'm in a vinyl mood don't have to necessarily listen to it through my hifi system.Plus can use it with any other Bluetooth enabled media, mainly my phone (moto g9 play) Sony nw-a55l and galaxy tablet. They sound great on all.The other huge bonus is freedom no trailing wires and the pick up from them.I can't comment on noise cancelling as only used indoors.Bluetooth :The range is up to 10 metres so pretty good ie can be in another room to the phone etc.No real problems with pairing stuff.Charge is absolutely amazing. It takes days to even dip below 50%Comfort to wear, as a glasses wearer they can get a bit uncomfy after extended wear but par for the course.They won't pair with a pre 2016 sony bravia but then I've never actually found anything that would pair with my bravia from 2014 yet.Hope this is helpful :)",Sony Wireless Bluetooth headphones 🎧
Nandy Rewman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So whilst this pandemic has gotten me down, I decided to treat myself. With these headphones I can now listen to music whilst I'm shopping, or stood outside the supermarket waiting to enter.The only problem is, I kind of forgot where I was and what I was doing one time.I was walking down the pantry aisle, looking at raman and pasta stuff (as you do) and I was listening to that Nirvana song ""heart shaped box"".Well my guy wasnt really feeling clever, and I could feel a lot of gas coming.So without even thinking, I'm singing along to this song and when it gets to the guitar riff, I let out 7 sharp blasts in time with the 7 beat guitar melody and just carry on singing as I walk away  leaving a toxic vapour trail behind me.About 5 seconds later I noticed a young (and attractive) store worker looking at me with a disapproving look. It took me a little while longer to realise why she was shaking her head at me and what I had done to offend her senses.I. WAS. MORTIFIED!!!I quick walked my ass to the checkout and paid for my goods so quickly, I'm pretty sure I accidentally signed up for a Necter card. I jumped in my car and sat there for a good few minutes, headphones off, farting occasionally and wishing a hole would just open up and swallow me.Haven't been back in the store since.To its credit, the headphones work perfectly. Unfortunately it was my body that failed me that day",The whole world can still hear me...
Skippysan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The husband has been working from home all week since we both have covid; sharing the same space has been hard. I have had to stay quiet all day while he is on conference call meetings. After a week of staring at the walls all day I decided to buy these. They are a bit fiddly  to connect to our LG smart tv, but it is the tv being difficult, not the headphones. the sound is good, no lag when watching sky Q/netflix. i am able to use my usb C charger to charge these which is nice. They work good for what i need them for and don't cost a fortune fyi i am a loyal sony headphone customer for many years, as others are too expensive or inferior quality, and they need to keep up with my rugged lifestyle",great for self isolation with the husband
A. Owen,1.0 out of 5 stars,"These cannot maintain a Bluetooth connection with a device I'm sitting right next to. I just want to have headphones while I'm working from home. My laptop can maintain this, as I've happily used this with a bluetooth speaker (also by Sony) so I'm pretty convinced the problem is with these headphones. I've followed all the troubleshooting instructions on the Sony website (removed all other devices, checked nothing else is blocking signal (I'm right next to the laptop) etc. The final one is not feasible: sit at least 10 metres away from any wireless LAN - hahahhah! Welcome to a terrace house.I find this amusing since the Bluetooth speaker that does work is actually used closer to the Wifi spot. So clearly this is a headphone issue.",Bluetooth is rubbish
S. Carvalho,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of the best purchases of the lockdown. Having noisy children and still having to have those virtual meetings, I'm very pleased with this! Also amazing for listening to music as it has good bass and the sound is very clear. Yes, I don't know much of technical features and all those specific jargon people use to describe headphones, but for the others like me that only want a good product without having to sell a kidney, this is a fantastic purchase! And being wireless is a surplus, especially when you're cooking the kids lunch and still can listen to that webinar playing on your laptop because everyone knows that webinars from 11 am to 1 pm is the perfect timing to throw one! Speaking of which, they have such an amazing battery life! They last so long. Take today, for instance. They are saying low battery since yesterday and I forgot to charge them overnight and yes, they're still going for 3 hours now. One overnight charging lasts me for around 15 days, using about 10 hours a day. Very good!",Best headphones I've ever had!
Gavin F,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Presummary: These are excellent quality for the money. I'd previously bought two cheaper brand headphones for my son's and had to return them. I bought these instead and I am not disappointed in any way: Deep bass and lightweight but sturdy feel. Only audiophiles will notice small quality issues. These are generally amazing headphones for the price!Overly wordy review:You can just tell immediately that this is Sony:- Unboxing and noticing the quality and ingenuity of the packaging alone make you appreciate just how far the effort of design goes. Inside the box is the headphones themselves, a short charging cable and there is also a set of the usual paperwork and a set of very simple to follow, pictured instructions for initial charging and connections.After charging, I connected the headphones very simply and quickly to our TV. I was instantly impressed by the comfort of the earpieces. I've never really had on-ear ones before because the ones I've tried in the past have been uncomfortable when wearing glasses, but these just sit nicely on them. They feel nice but secure and even managed to stay on with a few headbangers being played. I listened to a variety of different music for over an hour and it didn't feel the slightest bit uncomfortable, awesome for those extended study *cough gaming* times.The sound is impressive! They're more suited to modern music as they're heavy on the bass ranges; even in higher mid or treble sounds they somehow seem to echo deep resonance of bass. I haven't found a way to change any EQ on the headphones themselves so I'll have to play around with them on different devices and see how they are with those. Ultimately, in no way does this focus on bass impact your listening experience. Sony have done an amazing job on such a cheap pair of headphones!Also, I've had them for a short while now and I had to add in that the battery life is astounding. I can use them for hours and they are still fully charged. I haven't tried running them down completely and seeing just how long they go for yet, but I'm planning on it and will update again.",Sony Quality 👌
N. Johansen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The wh-ch510 is much quicker than the jabra move, which I have also reviewed.  When it has all been made to work, you turn them on by holding the button for a few seconds, it then goes: (beep)...Power on...Battery fully charged...(beep)...Bluetooth connected...(1 or 2 seconds hesitant sound), and then they work.  It speaks with a female voice, and when it works, it takes away the sound that comes through the normal (wired) sound card.  There is, I must assume, a sound-card in the usb-dongle.  I tried a few random cheap usb-dongles, and they all work the same way.  The button you must press on the 510 is not easy to find without looking (it is flanked by up and down buttons), and if you find the headphones lying around, there is no light to tell you that they are on.  I could wish for a sliding on-off switch, and perhaps an on-light.  The sound is fine, I listen to youtube-like material, not high-bit-rate music.",The 510 is fine
Mark Booth,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know what I was expecting from this headset, I didn't expect audiophile sound, or premium build quality, but I wasn't expecting an unpadded hard plastic head strap that digs into my head, is uncomfortable within a minute and unbearable within 10!I ended up wrapping the headset strap in bubble wrap until a third party strap cover arrived, and that was another tenner I shouldn't have had to budget for.Sound quality as headphones is Ok, about what I'd expect at this price point, but the microphone has incredibly irritating feedback. I wasn't expecting it it to be as good a noise cancelling headset, but the microphone picks up the headphone output, which it echoes back a fraction of a second later, causing a feedback loop. This makes it sound like you're in a cave as soon as you switch from headphone to headset mode.I wanted on-ear headphones as my ears over heat in over-ear headphones, but these clamp with enough force that even the soft leatherette pad start to get hot and uncomfortable after not too long.Charging is also irritating. It tells you how much charge is left when you turn it on, which is useful if it's low, but it would be more useful for it to tell you the charge when you turn it off. Since you can't use this headset while charging, it would be useful to know that it's worth putting them on to charge while you don't need to use them, rather than only finding out you need to charge them when you do want to use them.Overall these were very disappointing given the well respected brand. They were obviously made to a price point, but some of these problems would be so easy to fix. A few pennies for strap padding, a few more for a microphone jack port, a few more for a power management IC which allowed use while charging, these could have rounded off the worst rough edges of this product.",Uncomfortable head strap and terrible microphone feedback mar what could have been a good product
Stefania,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Edit after 5months:cheap plastic, it is already extremely loose, does not stay in place._________I am using them right now so i will review with some pros and consPRO-Sound is ok, loud enough, decent bass:-Very ligh-like the movement and the fact that on the neck, the headset can be twisted 90deg- paring is quite quickCONS-when on a phone call, there is a tremendous echo (that other mentioned). Nothing that can be done.It will also amplifies sounds from the background such an ambulance, people talkin, or your colleague sipping a smoothie..-no foam on the head-to change a song you have to press for 2.5 secs and if you use them for long distance running, it is not practical at all",I have cheaper headphones that do the same job...
MR STEPHEN CROCKFORD,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to use at the gym, as buds kept falling out when sweaty and fed up with cables/cords. Had a nice set of Jabra headphones but they were too heavy for gym and had too much padding, making them too hot. These Sony headphones are perfect for the gym, lightweight, not too hot and fit really well. I was also very surprised by how good the noise cancelling is, a tiny bit of sound gets out when over 75% but nothing really noticeable in a noisy gym. The bass is also nice and deep and good volume too. For the money these are brilliant value, very happy indeed.",Great value
Andy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow, where do I start on these. I did my homework and bought these because of good reviews and battery life but...I received the headphones and immediately realised how flimsy they were. I connected them with no issue, played music and it was so uninspiring. Some of the music could’ve been playing in mono although classical and live music was a little better. I took them off as the treble felt so distant and several times looked to see if there was something stuck inside them. The bass is thumping so loud it drowns everything on most music. You turn them up and it just goes beep. The reason these last 35 hours is because you can’t turn them up that loud and even when you do using an equaliser from the phone, the bass is awful and the treble is crass and distorts with the mids non existent. I installed the equaliser to turn up the treble and turn down the bass but you either have it so you can’t hear the treble or the bass blasts out. Having the equaliser made the headphones better but not great. A pair of Sony headphones shouldn’t need it.They are uncomfortable as the cups are small and the headband digs in to your head but amazingly not that secure. Turning them round and putting left to right ear, actually makes them fit better! At mid to full volume the sound bleeds terrible, not from the cups but from the backs. I put them flat on the table cups facing down and could hear the music 2 rooms away! The Bluetooth cut out or jittered badly during playback 3 times in as many days when the phone was right next to it. The range was pretty good though.I thought to myself, they can’t be this bad? So I contacted Sony who got me to try a couple of things but in the end said to contact Amazon, which is what I’ve done. After using 2 other cheaper sets of Sony headphones and a Sony Bluetooth adapter daily for years with no major quality issues I was very disappointed with the 510s. With all these reviews I would say my set were a Friday afternoon job but I guess I was just unlucky. I would buy Sony again but just not these.",Ok but not Sony quality
Mr. A. Wright,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Firstly, this review is based on the couple of hours I was in possession of them as I chose to send them back as they are not fit for purpose. My purpose is less about listening to music than it is to use as communication with others.So, SIDETONE is now my arch nemesis when it comes to headphones. This is my first set of non analog headphones I have purchased and not knowing about what sidetone was, was the downfall in the product.What is sidetone?Sidetone is a technology which means you hear yourself in the headphones whenever the microphone input is active. Its goal is so that you can hear how the other person would hear you AND also allow audio recording tools to be able to record the full conversation on one input rather than pulling from multiple sources.Sidetone in computing however is fairly redundant as every system is capable of recording multiple sound streams into a single audio stream. This is my primary area of use and have no need to have it. Its an annoyance andI certainly can't hear myself think if I'm hearing my own words twice!Sound quality when NOT using the input however is really good. I am not one for audio quality generally but its clear enough especially for the price.Other plussesAppears to be very lightweight, its comfortable enough but I can understand why people would suggest lack of a soft headband at the top makes a difference.Battery life suggested that it was still full after about an hour of light use so thats a positive too!IF sidetone was capable of being switched off (it's not), I would definitely consider purchasing these again. Until then, I am going for another brand.",Great if you want wireless headphones... not if you want a headset!
D,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are the best Bluetooth headphones under £50. That’s it.I’ve tried & returned several.At £35-£40 they are excellent value.The battery life is incredibly good. Lasts weeks of daily use before recharge is required. 30-40 hours life.Build quality is very good.They are comfortable. I go for a 1 hour walk everyday wearing these & never had ear aches or any pains. There not to tight or to loose. Not too big. I wouldn’t want a pair of large cans out & about. I definitely wouldn’t want a pair of moronic looking sucker Beats headphones. These are subtle.I tried several budget in ear headphones under £70 & they were all disappointing. Uncomfortable & impractical.These are by quite a margin the best value & most practical.They sound good too. Balanced bass, mids & treble. The EQ on my iPhone in Rock works best for me.Their so good I’m considering buying a 2nd pair for spare.Excellent work Sony. 5 Stars Plus.",5 Stars Plus. - Excellent Value Bluetooth Headphones.
Mr. M. Cheung,3.0 out of 5 stars,"They felt quite cheap which given the price is forgivable.  At this price point for a brand like Sony, I guess you have to accept some compromises somewhere.The headphones paired with my phone easily enough. However, that's about where the good news stopped.I'm really not an audiophile by any means.  But the bass on these were just way too much.I guess if that's the way you like your music then these will suit you.  If you want things balanced then these aren't the headphones for you.I did compare them to my son's Beats which are famed for being bass heavy and these were even worse.",Way too much bass
Shouvik Mitra,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a very good headphone and a real value for money at £30.  For the price it is definitely best in class.Pros:Balanced sound. Good bass. Volume loudness is pretty good and won’t hurt your ears even at max volume which is sony’s signature. I use at about 60-70% volume indoors and that is sufficient for me. I listen to mostly rock music and its really great.  Noise cancellation is decent for the price. Comfort wise it is good. Anyway those using glasses would find a bit of discomfort after using for a long time but that is more or less same for any on/over the ear headphones. Battery life is amazing.  I have compared with my synheisser wired over the ear. Sound quality wise both are same (compared at a certain volume). Loudness in the synheisser is bit more but I did find the sony loud enough, to be honest. Synheiaser is also a great brand when it comes to sound but are costlier. You won’t get the same at this price.Cons:Build is very basic but see the price.Voice call is average not bad though but my wired hands free is better.",Great value for money. Balanced sound quality.
Dave G,2.0 out of 5 stars,"A very mixed bag I’m afraid, they look very stylish (I had white), sound is very good and actually better than my Sony MDR-XB950 wired headphones and that’s the good.  Instructions are woeful and there’s way too much EU documentation,  the Sony Web site is far, far better if you want instructions, the cans are way to small and very uncomfortable for an adult male, they would probably be better for kids and anyone with a small head/ ears.Connectivity is a nightmare and the reason I returned mine, no matter what I tried I just could not get them to work with a Bluetooth equipped laptop, yes I could pair but couldn’t get them to connect  (many mins spent in Device manager settings etc).They did however pair and connect with my iPhone, and yes iPhone Bluetooth etc was disconnected in a vain attempt to get the headphones to connect to the laptop, the Sole reason for getting the headphones In the first place.",No can do.
Nessie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super easy set-up, came fully charged and took seconds to pair with my phone and laptop. Comfy headset, lightweight and the band fits my weeny noggin. Decent bass, balanced mids and highs. Looks great too and they're pretty compact when swivelled to lay flat. 10/10 would recommend.","Comfy, great sound and looks great!"
Topcat,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Remembering that these are very cheap for bluetooth headphones, i.e. you're not going to be able to compare them to £200 audiophile headphones... these are actually excellent.The battery seems to last forever (30% used for about 20 hours so far... probably because I'm not blasting them out on a train, and my bluetooth connection is close to the headphones). Comfort is fine, build quality is as expected at this point (it's ok, but it is an all plastic construction). Sound quality is actually pretty decent.For home use I much prefer these over earbuds, far more comfortable and, less percussive/exhausting feeling on the ear drums (even though the bass is very nice).Just to add, I've never been a Sony fanboy, to be honest i've always been a bit snobby about Sony and picked other 'audiophile' level brands, but these headphones comprehensively prove me wrong, Sony have made a nice thing here at a very sensible price.Would definitely buy again.","Been using these for a few weeks at home, very good for the price"
Andrea Caleo,1.0 out of 5 stars,"When you are on a call and the microphone is activated, an ingenious ""Sidetone"" feature by Sony is turned on. This can't be disabled. It scoops up any background noise, from mouse clicking to your voice, and amplifies it in your ears. That makes it very obnoxious to be on a call with these headphones.The sound quality and comfort were otherwise good. If you plan to use them for sound only, they are fine. If you want to use them on a call, they are not.",Absolutely terrible echo. Would not recommend.
Tony,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought these as a cheap replacement for my pair of MDR-XB650BT as I couldn't find replacement ear pads (found some now and will be replacing and keeping the MDRs) .The WH-CH510 at first are much lighter. But then in comparison they're almost too light, feel almost made cheaply, not solid like the MDRs.  Fit OK, not too tight with them being so light but the ear pads are smaller than the MDRs so the noise cancelling doesn't work great.After a quick charge, connected them to my Xperia, simple connection, opened prime music and tried some bassy korn, slipknot, mushroom head to name but a few.  Sound, bass almost difficult to tell the MDRs and these WHs apart. Not what I expected after the cheap feel of the product.If anything the MDRs extra bass was that tiny more noticeable but the mid range on the WHs was a little clearer. Probably due to the ear pads fitting slightly better over my ears.Connecting to Windows 10 was much slower to action than my Android phone.Using the WHs for chat (Teams) they give a very weird feel as you hear yourself much more than the MDRs - it's like a very odd echo like if you were in a small empty room.Surprisingly good sound from an inexpensive pair of headphones. Only marked down because of the cheap feel of them.",Recommended
Hiace Drifter,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've never used bluetooth headphones before, as I was convinced wired would be superior. Well I finally made the change and boy am I glad I did. I went from £30 sennheriser wired to these, and i think these sound better. The bass is weighty, detail is really good. They're light and comfortable, charge lasts ages, work well with phonecalls too. I haven't even ready the manual yet, so there are probably more functions i've not yet tested! Not having the wire is the best bit - I always used to get tangled up, now i'm free! I spent £50 on these, and would not have minded paying £100, they are that good.",incredible value
D. J. Roberts,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wanted bluetooth headphones for iPhone and Kindle Fire in garden/bed without trailing wires all over the place.  For background music, Netflix, Prime etc, but primarily Amazon Audible.  Great sound required (always!!) but not top drawer hi-fi in this instance, and these will do very well.A little hard on top of my (large) crown but not unbearably so.  Not sound cancelling, but not needed anyway, and am unconcerned about phone call features, so can't comment on that.  They hold a charge well and you get a message powering up which says how much charge is left.  They store flat which helps portability.Connected to my phone, Kindle and pc very easily.  Sound is a lot better than I expected for the price.  Right out of the box it is rich but not plumby, bass is deep enough and tight, not blowy, boomy or synthetic.  The voice and midranges are crisp and accurate.  So music/voices sounds clear, natural and realistic and this is just what I want given what I am using them for.  A little ""tight"" but this will mellow with use over the next few weeks.  Likewise the stereo picture, which is a bit left sided brand new, should balance out as I break them in.  When there is no sound, the speakers are absolutely silent.So far so perfect BUT what has SONY done with the charging system??  The lead is standard cheap quality and VERY short (20cm tip to tip).  Most annoyingly for me is that whilst it's standard USB at one end the input on the earphone is something I haven't seen for years.  WHY??  I use a high speed charger and cables which I use for everything else but which don't fit the earphone input.  Yes, it charged from new in a couple of hours (rather than the 4.5 hours suggested) using the  charge, but why not the universal terminals everyone else uses???  So  DON'T throw away the provided lead as I usually do and above all DON'T lose it!! (I suspect SONY are getting rid of old stock/parts).However, I have bought Sony products of all types many times over the years and they have never disappointed performance wise.  I wouldn't pay the original £50 tag (I got them on Amazon recently at £30) and they are not meant to be hi-fi quality headphones.  However, I would absolutely recommend them for a very good, comfortable, well balanced and accurate sounding fun listen.",I'm giving FIVE STARS But read on............
midejide,4.0 out of 5 stars,"These are alright headphones. I would rate 3.5 out of 5 if I could as I believe it's fitting.Battery life is excellent, I use them for a number of hours on a daily basis and charge about once a week. I've had them for about exactly a month now and have charged them 3 times.They are comfortable to wear for hours on end but during the heatwave last week a bit of sweat built up on the ear muffs. I won't knock any points off for that because that weather was just freakish tbh. But if you'll be using these in hot/arid climates - watch out for this.Sound is good and loud but I can't help but feel there's a bit of noise leakage sometimes so I never go full volume because of paranoia.Now the reason I said 3.5 instead of 4 is definitely the microphone. It's absolutely awful. If you're using this for meetings just switch mic settings to your computer mic because these make the headphones sound hollow, you hear all sorts of weird noises you normally wouldn't (e.g. moving in your chair, birds in the garden etc) also the volume goes all the way down and all sound is distorted.Would really be good to get a better fix or not include the microphone - ruined a decent product.For the price they are decent. I just wish there was no microphone.",Decent headphones
Travelling Bob,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Used a handful of times so my son can watch TV and we aren's disturbed and initially they worked really well. So easy to connect to all devices I tried and without problems. Long battery life, comfortable etc Then after three months they just stopped working. They still show as connected but sound will not play through them. I've been through all the trouble shooting on the SONY website and nothing fixes it. They say to return them to Amazon but Amazon say to return them to Sony. I guess you get what you pay for. Now looking for alternatives",Great at first - until they stopped working within three months
lefty,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted a second pair of decent Bluetooth headphones, primarily for watching TV or listening to Spotify and Amazon Music on my phone and tablet. I didn’t want to pay a fortune as I already have a pair of Sony’s that were around £100 mark so I went for these and was pleasantly surprised,They have really decent sound quality in the price range, though I did expect the volume to go a little higher than it does as it’s not overly loud even on maximum volume setting - my more expensive Sony’s seem to be louder than these,That’s only a minor criticism though, because they do sound decent. I wouldn’t say they are overly Bass heavy either, in fact - having listened to a pretty wide selection of music, Sony seem to have got the balance pretty good across the board, I just wish they have a bit more punch in the volume department,One thing to mention though, they do feel really lightweight, and at first they seemed really cheaply made compared to my others, but then taking into consideration the price and the fact these are meant to be portable and lightweight for talking with you and listening to music on the move, it’s logical why they have been made this way,Would I recommend them? - well for what I wanted, definitely yes but it depends what your looking for. If your after a decent no frills pair of Bluetooth headphones with decent sound quality, but are not to worried  about build quality - these are ideal without a doubtEnjoy!",For the price - Excellent
Andrea,4.0 out of 5 stars,"After 1 week using: Bought for 34 (cyber Monday) I can absolutely say that the price is very good for what you have in hands then. Audio quality is good, I'd prefer more realistic bass, this headphones has bass but it's kind of pumped (bass with makeup), compared to a pair of more expensive AKG (wired), but for 34£ and via Bluetooth it's ok. Mid and high range frequency good, nothing bad to say. Comfort enough good for the price. Battery (first week) very long duration. Isolation medium, at half volume, if you put the headphones on a table while music playing, you can hear it, so the same form out to your ear, but there's a bit of isolation. You can understand the real audio quality of this headphones in a quiet room, not on a bus.I'm happy about this purchase.",Good headphones for the price you pay.
matt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These are a great pair of wireless headphones.The sound quality is very good for the price.  Bass is weighty, treble is nice and clear.  They go up to a respectable volume.Comfort wise they're not the best I've worn, however they don't cause any aches or sore spots and are very lightweight.  I wore them for 14 hours straight and didn't notice any discomfort.The battery life is impressive. I can get 20+ hours use, at high volumes, before needing a recharge.  They boast up to 32 hrs play back, and I don't doubt these headphones could achieve that.They charge quickly, I've not timed it exactly, but half an hours charge will last you a good 8 hours, at least.These are rather good for the £35 I paid, which is why they get a deserved 5 stars, even though the sub categories score 4 stars a roos the board.",Excellent value
Mark Scott,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Bluetooth 5? Big deal. A lot of makers tout this as if it reduces lag/delay - it doesn't, that's a function of the codec (encoder/decoder) used. These  use the bog-standard SBC codec (although they can also decode AAC for higher quality) which produces lag of c. 1/5 of a second (200 mS) or more. That's about 5 frames of film - 2 frames (80 mS) is about the maximum that will go un-noticed by most people, 5 is unwatchable for most (believe me, this is 'buyers remorse' speaking).ETA >> If you use a bluetooth transmitter from an analogue source such as headphone jack the lag is even worse, TV/movies are *completely* unwatchableOtherwise, audio quality and overall functionality is decent enough, adequate for casual listening.",Bluetooth 5 does NOT mean low latency/lag.
NRE1985,4.0 out of 5 stars,I was after a pair of under £50 wireless headphones for listing to podcasts and music on during my commute and came across these on Amazon. Reviews were alright and I trust Sony gear.I’m really pleased with them for £30. The battery life is amazing and I only needed to charge them after two weeks after using them for about 22hrs a day.I give them 4 stars as the sound quality is only average but to be fair I didn’t expect more for the price. I’ve had AKGs previously and their sound quality is brilliant. They also don’t cancel noise at all but then again they don’t claim to and sometimes I think it’s better to hear your surroundings when you’re walking around London!Great buy for the price and I’ll get loads of use out of them.,Great for the price
K. Smith,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound is great on these headphones, really rich and plenty of bass.  They are also very light and comfortable to wear.  However, I have to keep pairing these every time I want to use them.  I use them with my television and once paired and connected, the TV shows them in the list of paired audio devices.  However, the next time I use them, after switching them on, the TV detects them and asks me if I want to use the headphones, so I click on yes to allow them to be used.  They connect ok, but after a couple of seconds they bleep and the headphones say ""pairing"", but nothing happens.  To get them working I have to remove them from the list of paired devices, re-pair them and then connect again.  Then they work ok, but I have to do this EVERY time I switch the headphones on.I also get a few sound drop outs, only very brief, but annoying nonetheless - and it's not a distance problem as I'm only 2 to 3 meters from my TV.",Have to keep re-pairing
Mark Newman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound from these headphones, for the price point, is great, I honestly can't fault it (I'm no expert). My only real issue is that there is no padding at all across the top of the head band. If you're like me and have no natural padding (i.e. hair) then it doesn't make for the most comfotable situation. To exacerbate that the head band is curved slightly front to back, meaning instead of a flat piece of plastic resting on your head you get two edges.All in all these are great headphones, shouldn't be a problem for anyone with hair or who wants to wear them over a cap though.Edit: after a few more days use the lack of padding has proved not as bad as I initially thought. They just took a bit of getting used to. I wear these for running quite a bit and haven’t had any issues.",Great sound... not great for baldies
Phillip,1.0 out of 5 stars,"An awful, cheap feeling pair of nasty, plasticky headphones. They are either so tight your brains are being squeezed out or, if you adjust the band sufficiently to reduce their vice-like grip, the head band is so tall that the ear cups sit on your cheeks.Not to mention the echo. These headphones have something called ""Sidetone"" so not only can you hear your own voice in a call, you also get it blasted back at you straight into your own ears. It's thoroughly unpleasant and, helpfully, cannot be switched off. I wish I could return them, but you have to open the box to find out how awful they are.",Echo...echo...echo
Taz I,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this headphones for a couple of days and have given it the time and attention it needs before writing this review.First and foremost, the look of the headphones are very appealing. I've picked out the blue option, looks very sleek and minimalistic. The Sony name on the side of the earpads adds a bit of subtle sophistication. I do feel their is a design flaw in which the actual headband of these headphones don't fold and collapse and only the earpads can do this. Would've made this product more compatible.The sound is generally good, it comes across very crisp and clear. There is some bass involved but it's obvious that it's not that of a high quality. I do feel you don't need to up the volume to listen to it's clear sound, having it at low volume was loud enough for me. Regardless how high you have the volume, people can hear the sound coming from your headphones and in some cases it was very clear to hear - hence why I recommend using these headphones at low volume.In terms of comfort, it's ok. At some parts it's really comfortable but if you use for long periods it does become a bit of a strain. My ears heated up if I were to use these headphones for a extended period of time. As someone with a bald head, the headphones tucked tightly onto my ears and even with general head movements it very much stayed on. Again, I do feel if you were to use these headphones at a low volume then it would appear to be more comfortable on your ears.Overall, I think it's a good headphone that is very much justified with the price. I would personally give this 3 1/2 stars out of 5. It very much does the job, I found the sound good, crisp and clear enough to play music and watch videos. The Bluetooth connectivity was smooth, there wasn't any delays with connecting to videos. I would uses these headphones to only listen to music on your own time,watching videos and taking calls. I wouldn't recommend using this in a gym as they are a bit bulky or even a bus journey, unless you want everyone on the bus to be listening to the sounds coming out of these headphones.It does its job, plain and simple. Personally, if you were to ask me whether I'd buy this again, my answer would be no. I would probably want to pay extra for that bit of quality that this headphone is desperately missing. In the meantime, I am content with this item and look forward to using them on a regular basis.",Plain and simple....
Vee Baker,3.0 out of 5 stars,These have a good sound quality but have some drawbacks that make me wish I had not bought them and are why I wouldn't recommend.1 - charging cable supplied is approx 6 cm long - so cannot use them while charging2 - would have preferred a cable that was the same format as my phone so could interchange cables3 - the 'sidetone' - which you can't switch off - which means you hear your own voice through the headphones as well as you typing etc is VERY annoying. Really wish I had been award of that and the fact that you can't use your Windows control settings to disable it as Sony thinks it is a 'valuable feature' is the biggesg issue for me as I spend 4-5 hours per workday on the phone. I guess I'll get used to it but kicking myself for not doing better research on these as headphones for phone calls not gaming/music.,Buyer beware
Mi L,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The headphones arrived charged, so they were paired and in use in minutes. Initial thoughts, the sound quality was good, and they fit fairly well. They were easy to turn on and the buttons were the clicky plastic kind. However, after a bit more use, I found they were awkward to try and put away in my bag; though they folded in, they still remained a flat large disk in volume. As they didn’t come with a case, I often worried as I put them in my backpack among my other things. This stemmed mostly from the build quality. Though the cups felt more solid, the sliding band and rotating parts felt a bit flimsy in my hands. They weren’t brittle, as I could bend them to fit my head, but just holding them, they felt light and didn’t assure me of any thick and rigid build safety. The cups weren’t pillowy soft, but they didn’t end up hurting my ears until a good couple of hours in.However, overall the sound quality was good; clear throughout most of my songs, although the bass wasn’t as deep as I’d like. I also tried walking with them on and they stayed on well, but I could hear the wind blowing if it was anything more than a breeze.In the end, I opted for some more conveniently stored/handled true wireless earphones.","Decent sound and function, but not for getting around often."
EMBEY,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have 3 pairs of headphones. My £200 pair are for when I want the best I can afford. The next best pair are around £130 and have metal frame and super soft ear pads I can fall asleep in and not worry about breaking. Now the 3rd pair category I place these ""ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SONY HEADPHONES"" in is everyday bump,drop use. I am a Postman and I have to hear a little background noise hence why I brought ""On Ear"". Please trust me in that I expect these to last 2-3 years of 6 days a week and average 4-5 hrs a day use. My last 2 pairs of Philips I used for every day also did a outstanding job!. But the build quality of the Sony I'm reviewing are far superior!!!. I have nothing to gain buy asking you to ignore the negative reviews. I'm bald and there is no issue in comfort whatsoever. They are street cred, with a fabulous sound and puncy Bass. What great new feature I really love is when intuating a call, a exterior microphone amplifies the surrounding. So you can hear if the wind is going to disturb the other person and hearing your own voice actually stops you walking along sounding like ""Dom Jolly ,lol"" shouting for all to hear how much you love your partner etc. Another thing which is great is the playback time, 4 days Ive had and roughly about 4hrs a day  and still I have over 50cent battery.I cannot fault these great Sony's , personally I wouldn't jog in , but I would be doing over 10 miles and they wouldn't be waterproof. All said and done at £50 down to £35 a 10/10 quality everyday stylish Sony rocks and Works pair","Pls read for a honest review ,I Cannot fault"
Jyoti,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I was looking for a headset which was not Jabra expensive but something with good clear sound and microphone. I saw this on the store for £32.95 and bought it as I love Sony products and didn't expect to see one so cheap! I was skeptical initially about the built in microphone but I've been bowled over at how good this is for the price.I think if you're going to use it for Teams/Zoom calls this is great. I've had it for about a week and I use it intermittently on calls throughout the day so it's on for about 8 hours a day. So far I've only charged the battery once initially when I got it, and not charged it since then. So thumbs up on battery life.As for the sound quality, crystal clear, can't fault Sony for that. The microphone is also clear and no disturbances for me. I've got medium size ears and I wear glasses and I don't find the fitting of the headphones an issue. Fits perfectly on my ears and around my head.As for the noise cancelling, I didn't really get it for that, but I do find that it shuts out a lot of noise but not exactly noise cancelling if that's what you want. When you're on calls or listening to music there's not much of a leak unless you listen to music really loudly.All in all for £33 quid this is a really sensible purchase if you don't want to spend another £40-£60 on Jabra equivalents or go for the cheap £15-£20 options.",Great for work calls
Ant,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought Sony bluetooth headphones years ago which I still use on a daily basis, however these were purchased for my teenage daughter who also uses them daily and thinks they are brilliant.The sound quality is excellent and they are very easy to connect to other devices. The battery life is also really impressive. In terms of comfort there is no real padding on the arch but she hasn't complained about it and when I used them I didn't find the lack of padding an issue either however the headphones are comfortable to wear and fit quite snug.These lightweight headphones really do offer great value for money and when the time comes to replace my previous model, I wouldn't hesitate to buy these as well.",A great upgrade from the ones before
Terri,5.0 out of 5 stars,I just wanted a set of headphones I could go on my daily walks with. I don’t know the ins and outs so just a basic pair was what I needed. These are great !! They connect to my phone perfect and have good Bluetooth range. They also connect to my Apple Watch and you can turn the song over by using the headphone it self rather than getting your phone out. The battery life is insane! I use them everyday and they last about a week without charge. It also tells you your battery percentage when you turn the headphone on. They take hardly anytime to charge also. Comfortable on my head and keep my ears warm! Can wear them with my hair up and even over a hat. ( Fashionable I know ) the actual ear bit folds down so sits on your neck comfortably when they aren’t in use. I’m a 5ft 3 female and they fit my head perfect on the smallest setting. Really happy with these. My one negative would be they don’t cancel out much noise but I can still hear my music. Really happy with them.,Great basic headphone !
Chucky Cheese,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I find these headphones to be rather confusing. I bought these to use with my Iphone as I have my whole library of MP3's saved onto the phone. These headphones produce decent sound, bluetooth connectivity can also be quite good although I have experienced a couple of cut outs from this device a few times.I find these to be ever so slightly louder than the previous version (WH-CH500) but at the same time less warm sounding whilst the bass tends to be a little more in your face. The CH500's I feel produced a better sounding package overall but considering the price these also do a decent job.One area where these fall down compared to the previous version is comfort. After a while of use, these tend to hurt quite a bit on the ear. It usually happens around 30 minutes after putting them on. With the CH500's I did not feel this was as bad. I could wear those for far longer before feeling any pain in my ears!Overall, a great sounding pair of headphones, just shame about the comfort.","Decent sound, decent bluetooth, shame about noise cancellation and comfort"
Phoenix Software UK,2.0 out of 5 stars,"*** UPDATE: After charging after minimal use (approx. 50hr total), they no longer work. The blue light is turned on, but it won't switch on or off. Very poor. ***Pros:- Good for the price- Good sound quality. Not great, but good.- Easy to set up and useCons:- Flimsy.- NOT NOISE CANCELLING. Not even in the slightest. I use these at a gym which has moderately volumed music on and I can hear it very clearly even with my music on full volume.- Not very comfortable. Could do with some padding along the headstrap as it is just hard plastic.- Don't sit brilliantly against the ears.Summary:If you can afford to splash out on some more expensive headphones, I would recommend doing so.If you're looking for some cheap, branded, easy to use headphones for using for a short amount of time then these are a decent choice.","Good, cheap headphones"
Alexandre Sa,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality is fine considering the price. The build quality is fine considering the price. The comfort levels are fine considering the price.The microphone is just utter rubbish when making phone or video calls.I don’t know what Sony is trying to achieve by making the microphone so sensitive.During a call, all you can hear is the echo of every sound that surrounds you.Other people on the call can hear more of the surronding sounds than the voice of who is speaking.During a work video call, while on mute, I could hear the echo of me tapping the keyboard and the echo sound of a printer at least 4 metres away.At first I thought it might be the sound settings on the laptop, but then tried it with a phone and a tablet and had exactly the same issues.I wasn’t expecting great quality based on price, but this is just not acceptable by a reputable company like Sony.Apparently this is caused by the Sidetone function, which cannot be disabled or adjusted.If you want the headphones to listen to music with above average sound quality, then these headphones are fine.If you want to use them for music as well as a wireless headset to make phone or video calls, I suggest you don’t buy these.",Sound OK. Microphone POOR.
